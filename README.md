# Birthify
> Javascript and React front end for Birthify, an application for creating Spotify playlists of songs that were released in the user's year of birth. 

Birthify uses the Spotify web API and the Spotify Web Player SDK to dynamically generate and play back Spotify playlists, as well as save them to the user's Spotify account. Users login with their Spotify credentials and enter their year of birth to create a new Birthify playlist.
